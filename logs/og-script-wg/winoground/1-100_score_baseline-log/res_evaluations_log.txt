However, the 'large living thing' mentioned in the caption accurately describes the mountain in the background, which could be metaphorically referred to as 'living' due to its natural aspect and the ecosystem it supports.

Although both entities are large and fitting to their descriptions as living and non-living accordingly, the way they are positioned doesn't quite fit the conventional understanding of one being 'in front of' the other, as they appear more side by side.
